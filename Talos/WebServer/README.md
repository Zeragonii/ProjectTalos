Contents of files


index.php - Primary web file for frontend usage, written in PHP for ease of coding.

jquery.js - AJAX JQuery functionality, makes it all work pretty much.

kibo.js - The most useful script in existence, effectively a listener for keypresses.

style.css - Bog standard stylesheet, thats about it.


Contents of folders


conn - Pretty much just base line database connections, easiest set of PHP in the book.

function - this is the handler for everything that kibo and jquery do, press W it sends that to database and so on..


If there's anything else in the folder then it's likely been added in at a later date, I'll attempt to keep this file as up to date as possible, but I cant make any promises.
